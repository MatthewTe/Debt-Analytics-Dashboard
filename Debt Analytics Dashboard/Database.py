MODULE NAME: df_main():
FUNCTION: This module uses the requests and bs4 packages to collect data from the stockpup.com
website and downloads all the avalible fundemental data .csv files as dataframes. It
then creates a main dataframe containing all the appended .csv files indexed by ticker.
This large, main dataframe is then stored in the 'Fundementals.db' sqlite3 database.
OUTPUT: Populates a sqlite3 database.
